# Howzit
A school project app mostly developed by me. This app lets users in the same wifi communicate with each other using Wifi Direct technology. 
Since it needs a handshake before starting a conversation, it has limited use cases.

I have pushed dirty code, so it may take a while to build and run on Android Studio. The repo contains a built apk @app\build\outputs\apk\debug folder.
